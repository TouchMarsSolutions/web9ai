# How-to become one Full Stack AI-Copilot Developer

- what is **AI-Copilot**?
    > AI-Copilot means using AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Github Copilot, Cursor, etc.) that help developers write code faster and with fewer errors. It uses machine learning to analyze code and provide suggestions for how to improve it. This article provides a comprehensive overview of five major programming languages: Java, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, and C#. We'll explore three fundamental concepts across these languages: variables, functions, and classes.

- what will we learn today (1 hour)?
    > we will learn all the major programming languages and frameworks that are used in the industry, in one-shot!

## Prerequisites
- Grade 7+ or 12+

## Outline - 3 Modules

> we will only learn 3 modules and each of them will apply to all the programming languages: variables, functions, and classes.


## Let's Begin Our Coding Journey!

Now that we've outlined our learning path, it's time to dive into the fascinating world of programming languages. We'll explore variables, functions, and classes across Java, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, and C#. 

Remember, the goal is **NOT to memorize every detail**, and **NOT to become an coding guru**, but to understand the core concepts thus to be able to build software products to generate revenue $$$ in real-world. This comparative approach will help you grasp the underlying principles of programming and adapt more easily to new languages in the future.

Let's start with variables, the building blocks of any program!

### Variables

:::info
- every language has variables, such as Math. All you need to understand in this module is only a few things:
  - what are the basic data types in each language?
  - how to define a variable?
  - how to assign a value to a variable?
:::


#### basic data types

Let's get a quick list of basic data types for each language:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java" default>
    - Number: byte, short, int, long, float, double
    - Boolean
    - String
  
    ```java
    var age = 18;
    var height = 180.5;
    var name = "Jack";
    var isStudent = true;
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old and " + height + " cm tall. Are you a student? " + isStudent);
    ```

    Result:
    > Hello, Jack! You are 18 years old and 180.5 cm tall. Are you a student? true
    
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    - Number: Byte, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double
    - Boolean
    - Char
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    - int, float
    - bool
    - str
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    - number
    - boolean
    - string
    - null
    - undefined
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="csharp" label="C#">
    - sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong
    - float, double, decimal
    - bool
    - char
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note: While Python and TypeScript have fewer "basic" types, they offer built-in complex types that are commonly used like basics in other languages.

### Functions

### Classes
