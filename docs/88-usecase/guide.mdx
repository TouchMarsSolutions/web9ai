#### ChatGPT

:::info
ChatGPT is the best model for text generation.
We emphasis it here because there are a bunch of hidden tricks to let you know
:::

<details>
<summary>You will love the ChatGPT Plus plan</summary>
1. It defaults to GPT-4 if you are a [plus member](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus) (USD$20/month)
2. The `Code Interpreter` can help you read files, such as `json`, `Java`, `Perl`, csv (for Excel to open), PDF files, etc. Try to ask it for anythiing on top of your mind :smile:, e.g., _'what is the problem with my Perl code?'_, _'where is the bug in my Java file?'_ etc.
